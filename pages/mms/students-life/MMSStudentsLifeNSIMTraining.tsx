Led by expert speaker Mr. Deepak Vakharia, the session focused on key topics like saving, budgeting, investing, and financial discipline. Through real-life examples and an engaging intra-day trading simulation, students learned about the risks and opportunities in capital markets. The session also highlighted career prospects in the financial sector and emphasized the importance of financial planning for long-term goals. Participants who completed the session received NISM and SEBI certifications, boosting their academic and professional credentials.`;
